# Software-Testing-Final-Project
Given all the java files our task is to:
1) Correct the error in the code to make it run (just to compile)
2) Develop test cases for parts of the system using white box testing technique
3) Develop test cases for the overall system using black box technique.
4) Write a presentation explaining the errors and the test cases you have generated as
well as the techniques used to generate the test cases. 

This will be done using the jUnit framework
